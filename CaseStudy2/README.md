# Case Study 2 - Doing Data Science


__Objective__

We have been hired by the __DDSAnalytics__ that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies, with the objective of predicting employee turnover using the existing employee data. These objectives include:
1. identify top 3 factors that lead to attrition
2. job role specific treands _(e.g., highest job satisfaction)_
3. build a model to predict attrition


__Executive Summary__
Please refer to this youtube clip for recorded presentation (<5mins) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qAkuMxDMnU

In summary to the objective, we found:

* Employee attrition– whre employees that were most likely to turnover are those that (1) most importantly workovertime and (2) have lower salaries. Also, we saw decreased in job involvement and increased time_till_promotion. 
* In terms of monthly income – Job Role and Job Level were key to predicting salary
* Age and Gender – Good news!  Yall are on the right track with employee management as both Age and Gender were not significant factors or indicators used in the models. We would indicate that there is a slight tendacy for those younger  in age to be more likely to leave. This was appartent in the Employee attrition model werhe maritial status = single, but Age itself was not a key factor. Contrary to other industries, the dataset provided indicated no significant indication gender was a key factor in turnover or a wage gap.
